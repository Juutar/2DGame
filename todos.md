## Say in interview

- the **tutorial** works as follows: each player is told what keyset they can use, and they are left to figure out by themselves what actions each of them can perform. There are no lives that produce a final game over and the reset iteration is very fast, so within ~1min of tutorial the players should have figured out all the mechanics and be comfortable to move forward.
- the **features** include:
  - collaboration gameplay
  - collecting the key to open the door
  - the dragon spitting fire
  - the start & end screens
  - the sound effects
  - the load & save
  - the specialized grounds
  - the bridges and buttons
